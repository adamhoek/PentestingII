Kali vs Live Targets
# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)
